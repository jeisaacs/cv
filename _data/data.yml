career-profile: 
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    A technology fan-boy who has turned his enthusiasm for the digital world into way of life.

    Across a wide variety of sectors, displaying highly proficient skills in Business Analysis, Project Management, and Product Management.

    Using both Waterfall and Agile methodologies building with, leading, and working in teams to develop, install and train customers to use award winning technological solutions. 

    When not at work, I enjoy reading (which I do frequently), having a catch up with friends (which I do frequently), and hitting the gym (which I dont do as frequently as I would like).
